This project focuses on predicting the occurrence of brain strokes by leveraging machine learning techniques. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of multiple classification models. The performance of these models is evaluated, followed by hyperparameter tuning to enhance their effectiveness.
